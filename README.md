# OCR-Ultimate

OCR Ultimate is an OCR application for android devices. It can detect both printed and hand-written English text in real-time, as well as from a captured image.

We have used Google Vision API, for detecting text real time, Google Tesseract for detecting text offline and OpenCV, to improve the detecting quality of Tesseract. Please see the presentation slide and the report for details.
